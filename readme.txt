Adds a [widget] shortcode which enables you to output widgets anywhere you like.

== Description ==

WidgetShortcode is a WordPress plugin allowing you to **turn any widget into a WordPress shortcode** or **display a widget with a dedicated block**. The shortcodes can then be used in posts, pages, and more.

It also has a dedicated block, making it easier to select a widget to show in the Block Editor.

It works great in the **classic WordPress editor**, but **also in the block editor** (for widgets that donâ€™t have a Gutenberg block) and other page builders. This way you are not limited to only sidebars and your choice of editing tools is not based on the block functionality of the plugins.

===  Automatic mode - WidgetShortcode block ===

This block can render any widget located in the WidgetShortcode position. First add widgets to the dedicated widget area. Then place the WidgetShortcode block, click it and select one of the widgets from the drop-down list.

=== Manual mode - the shortcode ===

The plugin adds a shortcode to every widget. You can copy this shortcode and paste it anywhere in WordPress. This alternative to automatic mode can be used if:
* You are not using the block editor
* You prefer to use a different block to render the shortcode
* You want to use one of the advanced parameters

=== Manual mode - advanced parameters ===

You can use additional parameters below to override HTML, CSS classes and ids. This section is for **advanced users**!

* `title`
  * Overrides the widget title
  * Set to `0` (zero) to disable the title
* `title_tag`
  * HTML tag to use for the widget title wrapper
  * Default: `h2`
* `title_class`
  * CSS class for the widget title wrapper
  * Default: `widgettitle`
* `container_tag`
  * HTML tag to use as the widget container
  * Default: `div`
* `container_class`
  * CSS classname added to the widget container
  * Default: `widget %2$s`
  * Uses `sprintf()` and can crash your website if used incorrectly
* `container_id`
  * HTML ID attribute for the widget container
  * Default: `%1$s`
  * Uses `sprintf()` and can crash your website if used incorrectly
